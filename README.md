## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Faizan

Iâ€™m a **Business & Data Analyst** passionate about building data-driven systems that connect analytics, automation, and business strategy. I use **SQL, Python, and Power BI** to design scalable dashboards, streamline workflows, and turn raw data into actionable insights. Currently at the **Metropolitan Council**, Iâ€™m working on initiatives to modernize asset data, automate reporting, and prepare infrastructure for **AI-powered decision-making**.

Beyond analytics, Iâ€™m interested in how great **products and companies** are built - where data meets storytelling, design, and execution. Outside of work, I love staying active, playing soccer, reading biographies & non fiction books, and explore new food spots and ideas.
